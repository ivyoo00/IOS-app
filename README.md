# IOS-app
To follow an example of app for ios

To follow the steps of building an app for IOS using Xcode. It's a single view application named FoodTracker. It shows a list of meals, including a meal name, rating, and photo. A user can add, remove, or edit a meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular meal.

I have follow the instructions by: Build a Basic UI, Connect the UI to Code, Work with View Controllers, Implement a Custom Control, Define Your Data Model, Create a Table View, Implement Navigation, Implement Edit and Delete Behavior, Persist Data.
